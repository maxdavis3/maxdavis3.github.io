      Have you ever saved over a file with revisions you didn't want? Ever updated a website and completely ruined it without knowing how? Version Control subverts these tendencies by giving a detailed log of all saves. They're like checkpoints in a video game but better. At each point, you can also add a custom message of how you got to where you are and what you changed. You can even go back and change things to make the file function better. On top of all of this, Version Control allows multiple users or groups to make and edit files.

        Git allows users to make, copy, move, edit, and export files all from your command line. This one incredible simple program can be infinitely complex for that reason. The user can manipulate input and pipe the output data into another file. This new data can in turn be tunneled, exported, and manipulated to other files and so on.

        Git can be linked to Github to access files through any computer. This is how multiple users share and update files. Storing files on Github is better for this reason. Users on the same project can also split an original master file into other directories that can be modified by multiple users in multiple groups. When each group finishes their portion, they can be merged back into the master file to create the finished product.
