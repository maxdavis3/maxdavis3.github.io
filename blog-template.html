<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I was sick this week and got to this section after the deadline. I unfortunately could not pair.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, it is very helpful to see what I want to create.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
I like images and a clean look. I believe clear prompts with lots of spacing makes a good wireframe.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
N/A
